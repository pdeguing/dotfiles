My very own config files, built from scratch just for fun. ðŸš€

I love UNIX and KISS. And I very much don't like bulky terminals, editors, shells
and config files. So I'm building my own setup, and it gets a bit better everyday.

This is my current config, I use iTerm, zsh and neovim. I created my own color
palette and my own theme for neovim and the terminal, inspired by Material
design.

My text editor of choice is Neovim. But I do use and IDE, its name is UNIX. ðŸ˜‰

A very simple shell, yet effective, I killed the whites so that my eyes survive:

And the best text editor on mother Earth, probably in the solar system,
[Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim):

You can even use Vim for text, markdown and latex, you just need to enable line
wrapping.
